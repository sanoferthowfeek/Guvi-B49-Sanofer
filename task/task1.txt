1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP:

        => HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
        => By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
        => There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

 HTTP/1.1:

        => It works on the textual format.
        => There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
        => It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
        => It compresses data by itself.
        => HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 

 HTTP/2: 


        => It works on the binary protocol.
        => It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
        => It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages .
        => It uses HPACK for data compression.
        => HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. 
        => HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
        => Binary protocols – Binary protocols consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed and are less error-prone than the textual protocols used by HTTP/1.1. Additionally, they can better handle elements such as whitespace, capitalization and line endings.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

        => An object, is a reference data type. 
        => Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
        => That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
        => The variables don't actually store the value.
        => Internal properties have special names that are written in double square brackets. 
        => Two examples: The internal property [[Prototype]] points to the prototype of an object.
        => An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
        => A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. 
        => Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.
        => objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
        => In JavaScript, objects have an internal property known as Prototype . 
        => You can also see that there is a Scopes inside of these double brackets as well once clicking inside an object. 
        => Whenever there are [[]] that appear, it's an internal property that can't be accessed by our code.



3.codekata practice-objects in javascript:
 
  let car {
  color = "green"
  model = "honda"
  year = 2022
  }
  console.log(car);

4.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address:

  IP address:
     => An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
     => IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

  Port:
    => A port in computer hardware is a jack or socket that peripheral hardware plugs into.
    => A port in computer software is when a piece of software has been translated or converted to run on different hardware or operating system (OS) than it was originally designed for.

 HTTP methods:
    => The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. 
    => HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. 
    => Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client.
